[surprised, dramatic] As soon as Sunny finished that thought [pencil tapping], all hell broke loose [explosion or loud crash].
[fearful, dramatic] The creature moved [soft footsteps on ground], slashing its claws [claws slicing through air] in his general direction.
[determined, dramatic] But Sunny was one step ahead: without wasting a single moment, he jumped sideways [footsteps landing on ground] — as far as the chain allowed — conveniently placing the broad-shouldered slave [body shifting] between himself and the monster.
[fearful, dramatic] His quick reaction saved his life, as those sharp claws, each as long as a sword, sliced through the broad-shouldered man [whoosh of claws cutting] a fraction of a second later and sent streams of blood flying [splash of blood] through the air.
[sad, dramatic] Drenched in the hot liquid [liquid splashing], Sunny hit the ground [thud of body hitting ground], and his fellow slave — now simply a corpse [silence of a lifeless body] — fell on him from above [heavy thump as corpse falls].
