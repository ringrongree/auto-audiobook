      "text": "Finally, the vault door opened, and a gray-haired policeman walked in."
    },

      "speaker": "Narrator",
      "text": "He had a seasoned face and stern eyes, looking like someone who had seen a lot of terrible things in his life."
    },

      "speaker": "Narrator",
      "text": "After checking the restraints, the policeman glanced quickly on his wristwatch and then turned to Sunny:"

      "text": "Sunless? That's a strange name."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sunny",
      "text": "What's so strange about it? At least I have a name. Back in the outskirts, not everyone even gets one."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sunny",
      "text": "It's because I was born during a solar eclipse. My mom had a poetic soul, you see."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Narrator",
      "text": "That's why he got this weird-ass name and his little sister was called Rain… back when she still lived with them, at least."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Narrator",
      "text": "Whether it was the result of poetic imagination or simple laziness, he did not know."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Narrator",
      "text": "The old policeman grunted."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sunny",
      "text": "There's no one. Don't bother."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Narrator",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sunny",

    },

      "speaker": "Old Policeman",

      "speaker": "Narrator",
      "text": "Not waiting for a response, he added:"

      "text": "How much do you know about the Nightmare Spell?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sunny",
      "text": "As much as anyone, I guess? Who doesn't know about the Spell?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Old Policeman",
      "text": "Not the fancy stuff you see in dramas and hear in the propaganda broadcasts. I mean how much do you really know?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Narrator",
      "text": "That was a hard question to answer."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sunny",
      "text": "Don't I just go into the Dream Realm, kill a few monsters to complete the First Nightmare, receive magic powers and become an Awakened?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Old Policeman",
      "text": "Listen carefully. Once you fall asleep, you will be transported inside your First Nightmare."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Old Policeman",
      "text": "Nightmares are trials created by the Spell."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Old Policeman",
      "text": "Once inside, you will meet monsters, sure, but you will also meet people."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Old Policeman",
      "text": "Remember: they are not real. They're just illusions conjured up to test you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sunny",
      "text": "How do you know?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Old Policeman",
      "text": "I mean, no one understands what the Spell is and how it works, right? So how do you know that they're not real?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Old Policeman",
      "text": "You might have to kill them, kid. So do yourself a favor and just think about them as illusions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sunny",
      "text": "Oh."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Old Policeman",
      "text": "A lot of things about the First Nightmare depend on luck."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Old Policeman",
      "text": "Generally, it shouldn't be overwhelmingly hard."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Old Policeman",
      "text": "The situation you're in, the tools you have at your disposal and the creatures you have to defeat should be within the range of your abilities, at least."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Old Policeman",
      "text": "After all, the Spell sets up trials, not executions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Old Policeman",
      "text": "You're a bit disadvantaged due to… well… your circumstances."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Old Policeman",
      "text": "But kids from the outskirts are tough. Don't give up on yourself just yet."
    },

      "speaker": "Sunny",
      "text": "Uh-huh."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Narrator",
      "text": "Sunny was getting more and more sleepy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Narrator",
      "text": "It was becoming hard to follow the conversation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Old Policeman",
      "text": "About those \"magic powers\" you mentioned… you will indeed receive them if you survive until the end of the Nightmare."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Old Policeman",
      "text": "What those powers will be, exactly, depends on your natural affinity as well what you do during the trial."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Old Policeman",
      "text": "But some of it will be at your disposal right from the start…"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Narrator",
      "text": "The voice of the old policeman sounded more and more distant."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Narrator",
      "text": "Sunny's eyelids were so heavy that he was struggling to keep his eyes open."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Old Policeman",
      "text": "Remember: the first thing you must do once inside the Nightmare is to check your Attributes and your Aspect."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Old Policeman",
      "text": "If you get a combat-oriented Aspect, something like a Swordsman or an Archer, things will be easier."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Old Policeman",
      "text": "If it is reinforced by a physical Attribute, then that's even better."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Old Policeman",
      "text": "Combat Aspects are the most common, so the probability of receiving one is high."
    },

      "text": "The armored room was growing dimmer."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Old Policeman",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Old Policeman",
      "text": "Sorcery and utility Aspects are useful in their own ways, you'll just have to be smart about it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Old Policeman",
      "text": "There are really no useless Aspects. Well, almost."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Old Policeman",
      "text": "So just do anything in your power to survive."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Old Policeman",
      "text": "If you survive, you will be halfway to becoming an Awakened."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Old Policeman",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Old Policeman",
      "text": "Which means that my colleagues and I will have to deal with it."
